# Documentation Organization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for organizing the NotAlone app documentation to serve both non-technical administrators and technical contributors effectively.

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── index.md                 # Landing page with clear pathways for different users
├── admin/                   # Non-technical administrator documentation
│   ├── quickstart.md       # Quick setup guide for admins
│   ├── infrastructure/     # Shared infrastructure setup docs
│   └── management/         # Day-to-day admin operations
├── developer/              # Technical contributor documentation
│   ├── quickstart.md      # Developer setup guide
│   ├── infrastructure/    # Advanced infrastructure details
│   └── technical/         # Development-specific docs
└── shared/                # Documentation shared between admin and developer
    └── infrastructure/    # Core infrastructure setup
```

## Key Principles

1. **Clear Entry Points**
   - Landing page (index.md) immediately directs users to their relevant section
   - Separate quickstart guides for admins and developers
   - Clear distinction between day-to-day operations and setup

2. **Efficient Content Management**
   - Shared infrastructure documentation lives in shared/ directory
   - Admin and developer sections reference shared docs when appropriate
   - Each section maintains its own version of infrastructure docs when needed for audience-specific details

3. **Navigation Strategy**
   - Admin section focuses on operational tasks and basic setup
   - Developer section includes technical details, contribution guidelines, and advanced configuration
   - Cross-references between sections when relevant

4. **Content Organization**
   - Admin documentation:
     * Emphasizes UI-based setup steps
     * Focuses on operational tasks
     * Uses more screenshots and visual guides
     * Simplifies technical concepts

   - Developer documentation:
     * Includes technical details and architecture
     * Covers contribution workflows
     * Provides API references
     * Includes debugging and development guides

5. **Infrastructure Documentation**
   - Core setup steps in shared/infrastructure/
   - Admin section references these with simplified explanations
   - Developer section references these with additional technical context
   - Prevents duplication while maintaining appropriate detail levels

## Implementation Notes

1. **Shared Content Strategy**
   - Use includes or references to shared documentation
   - Maintain separate context-specific wrappers for shared content
   - Clear indicators when viewing shared content

2. **Navigation Aids**
   - Clear breadcrumbs showing current location
   - Role-based navigation menus
   - Cross-references when content overlaps

3. **Content Differentiation**
   - Admin content: Focus on "what" and "how"
   - Developer content: Include "why" and "how it works"
   - Shared content: Core setup steps and requirements

4. **Version Control**
   - Shared documentation changes require review for both audiences
   - Audience-specific changes can be reviewed independently
   - Clear change management process for shared content

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Shared infrastructure docs prevent content duplication
   - Single source of truth for core setup steps

2. **Clear User Paths**
   - Users can easily find relevant documentation
   - Natural progression through setup steps

3. **Maintainable Structure**
   - Clear organization makes updates easier
   - Shared content reduces maintenance burden

4. **Scalable Approach**
   - Structure can accommodate new documentation
   - Clear places for new content types
